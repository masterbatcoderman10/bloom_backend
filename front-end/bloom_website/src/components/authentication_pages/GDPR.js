            <h3>3. Storage of your information</h3>
             Bloom securely stores your data at the remote server and will
            only keep your email address, username and password for 5 years
            after they are not being used. Once this time period has expired, we
            will delete your data from the remote server through an automated
            process. Additionally, the password is not saved in a text form, for
            security reasons it is stored in an unreadable form. Personal
            information collected on our Services is typically stored and
            processed in the United Arab Emirates; however, in some instances,
            it may be transferred, stored, and/or processed in other
            jurisdictions. It is important for you to note that the laws on
            holding data in any country in which we transfer, store, or process
            your data may be less stringent than the laws of your country, but
            Bloom intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Policy,
            unless otherwise required by applicable laws. By using our Services,
            you consent to the transfer of your personal information to any
            country in the world in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

            interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have about
            you. We might also use your personal data to show you digital
